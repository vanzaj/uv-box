    "\n",
    "## **XP Values**\n",
    "XP is built on **five core values**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Communication** – Encourage constant communication between team members and stakeholders.\n",
    "2. **Simplicity** – Focus on the simplest solution that works.\n",
    "3. **Feedback** – Get frequent, early feedback and adapt accordingly.\n",
    "4. **Courage** – Be willing to make necessary changes, including refactoring or discarding bad code.\n",
    "5. **Respect** – Support and respect team members, valuing diverse perspectives and contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **XP Practices**\n",
    "XP includes **technical and collaborative practices** that support agility and quality:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Fine-Scale Feedback**\n",
    "1. **Pair Programming** – Two developers work together on the same code to improve quality and share knowledge.\n",
    "2. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** – Write automated tests before writing the actual code to ensure correctness.\n",
    "3. **Whole-Team Approach** – Developers, testers, product owners, and other roles collaborate as a single unit.\n",
    "4. **Planning Game** – Use short planning cycles to estimate, prioritize, and adjust work incrementally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Continuous Process**\n",
    "5. **Continuous Integration (CI)** – Frequently integrate and test code to detect issues early.\n",
    "6. **Refactoring** – Continuously improve the structure of the code while maintaining functionality.\n",
    "7. **Small Releases** – Deliver working software in small, frequent releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Shared Understanding**\n",
    "8. **Simple Design** – Keep the design as simple as possible while meeting current needs.\n",
    "9. **System Metaphor** – Use a common metaphor to help team members understand the system architecture.\n",
    "10. **Collective Code Ownership** – The entire team shares responsibility for the codebase, avoiding silos.\n",
    "11. **Coding Standards** – Follow a common set of coding conventions for consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Programmer Welfare**\n",
    "12. **Sustainable Pace (40-hour workweek)** – Avoid overworking the team to maintain long-term productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Additional XP Principles**\n",
    "In addition to the values and practices, XP is guided by principles such as:\n",
    "- **Humanity** – Recognizing software development as a human activity.\n",
    "- **Economics** – Making decisions based on economic impact.\n",
    "- **Mutual Benefit** – Favoring practices that benefit both developers and stakeholders.\n",
    "- **Flow** – Ensuring a steady flow of work through the system.\n",

    "Haiku is a traditional form of Japanese poetry that captures fleeting moments of nature, emotions, or daily life in just 17 syllables, typically arranged in a 5-7-5 pattern. Rooted in Zen aesthetics, haiku emphasizes simplicity, seasonal references (kigo), and a cutting word (kireji) that adds depth or contrast. Originating from linked-verse poetry (renga), haiku was popularized by masters like Matsuo Bashō, whose works reflect a deep connection to nature and the transient beauty of existence. Modern haiku, while sometimes deviating from strict syllabic structure, continues to embody the essence of brevity and profound observation.\n",
